We are dedicated to finding and working with passionate and creative developers. Below are a few of the projects I have been involved in.</p>

Choosing 'pong' as our starting point, we worked on adding personality to the players, the games interactions, and the world itself.</p>

I work with an executive team, such as our treasurer, secretary, marketing director etc. each with our own roles and responsibilities. As president, it is my job to co-ordinate the team, overseeing the big picture of the society’s operations, and filling in any gaps. Our main interaction with our membership, mostly comprised of UTS students, is workshops run on a variety of programming topics, such as git, microservices, and test-driven development.</p>
						<p>We also run larger events, such as the weekend long Code2Change Hackathon, in which students worked with city planers on ideating future technological developments for Sydney. The largest event I have run was the 30th anniversary, which involved searching for and bringing back ProgSoc Alumni from as far back as start the University itself, and having them share their stories with newer students.</p>

						<p>The UTS Software Development Studio is a co-curricular program within the Faculty of Engineering and IT.

I have been participating in the studio since my first year of university, working with multiple teams on a wide variety of projects.</p>
						<p>The studio trains students to work in dynamic teams, focusing on agile coordination, with the more experienced members taking a leadership role. Over the years, I have become an industry mentor within the studio, mentoring newer students in both the technical and organisational skills.</p>

						<h2>My <strong>Research</strong></h2>
					</div>
					<span>As part of my commitment to both my own professional development, and to the industry as a whole, I am always on the lookout for new applications of agile methodologies. Most of my research work revolves looking at particular industries, technologies, or team dynamics, and suggesting implementations of agile ideologies that would best suit the situation. This research always involves a mix of theory and experimentation, as I will first conduct a preliminary reading into existing concepts to form a methodology, which will then be implemented into a team to test the findings. Here are some of my research projects:</span>

						<h3>Iterative User Stories</h3>
						<p>As team lead on a student project with <a href="https://honestybox.io/" target="">Honesty Box</a> (a network analytics start-up), I introduced the concept of iterative user stories into our team. Due to the experimental and spike focused nature of the project, this was an ideal situation to test this style of development. The case study outlines the background research into iterative user stories, and explores the effect this way of working had on our projects development, and on how we thought of and described acceptance criteria.</p>

						<h3>Automation for City Planning</h3>
						<p>This paper deals with the NSW city planning system, examining how the limitations in technology affect the field, and in turn how the policies and procedures within the field limit the implementation of automation. The idea for this project came about from a hackathon I ran through the UTS Programmers’ Society, where the focus was on the development of Sydney as a city through technology.</p>
						<p>As part of this research, a workshop was co-conducted by myself and a UNSW city planning student Pulock Islam as part of his thesis work. The report outlines the structure of the workshop, its benefits, and the resulting arguments and recommendations.</p>

						<h3>Alternative Applications of Agile Methodologies</h3>
						<p>This research project looks at the handling of user-centred and non-functional requirements with the current applications of agile methodologies. The research and development outlined in this proposal looks at the current limitations of existing agile applications, and asks how we can develop an alternative workflow model to better suit user driven projects.</p>
						<p>The topic premise was developed from my experiences with agile teams in small to medium sized development teams focused on user facing product design in both the workforce and with university programs. This project is co-ordinated through the UTS engineering capstone program and is planned to be developed with UTS programs such as the Software Development Studio and Games Studio, and potentially with local development companies for the research and development of new tools and practices.</p>
