I work alongside a team of experience design and product specialists to drive a design thinking approach that keeps the user at the front and centre.

						<h3>Fantasy Town Regional Manager</h3>
						<p>The flagship release from Caps Collective, FTRM is a turn-based roguelike city builder, where each day you have limited wealth to manage your city. As your city increases, it attracts more adventurers whose needs must be met. This game started as a student project, with the early prototype being the winner of the 2020 UTS Games Showcase. FTRM will be coming to PC in late 2021.</p>

						<h3>Smack Back</h3>
						<p>This project started with the idea of taking the simplest game premise and squeezing as much 'game juice' out of it as we could, as explored in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg" target="_blank">this talk</a>. Choosing 'pong' as our starting point, we worked on adding personality to the players, the games interactions, and the world itself.</p>

						<p>As the president of UTS ProgSoc, I worked with my team to coordinate and run multiple events with the aim to train up students. It was my responsibility to co-ordinate our executive committee, overseeing the big picture of the society’s operations, and filling in any gaps. Our main interaction with our membership, mostly comprised of UTS students, is workshops run on a variety of programming topics, such as git, microservices, and test-driven development.</p>
						<p>We also ran larger events, such as the weekend long Code2Change Hackathon, in which students worked with city planers on ideating future technological developments for Sydney. The largest event I ran was the societies 30th anniversary in 2019, which involved searching for and bringing back ProgSoc Alumni from as far back as start the University itself, and having them share their stories with newer students.</p>

						<p>The UTS Software Development Studio is a co-curricular program within the Faculty of Engineering and IT. Participants come from various majors and experience levels to work on a real project with real clients. I have been participating in the studio since my first year of university, working with multiple teams on a wide variety of projects.</p>
						<p>The studio trains students to work in dynamic teams, focusing on agile coordination, with the more experienced members taking a leadership role. Over the years, I have become an industry mentor within the studio, mentoring newer students in both the technical and organisational skills.</p>

						<h2>My <strong>Research</strong></h2>
					</div>
					<span>As part of my commitment to both my own professional development, and to the industry as a whole, I am always on the lookout for new applications of agile methodologies. Most of my research work revolves looking at particular industries, technologies, or team dynamics, and suggesting implementations of agile ideologies that would best suit the situation. This research always involves a mix of theory and experimentation, as I will first conduct a preliminary reading into existing concepts to form a methodology, which will then be implemented into a team to test the findings. Here are some of my research projects:</span>

						<img class="banner" alt="Image of the Honesty Box team at their project showcase" title="Honesty Box Project Showcase" src="images/honesty_box.jpg">
						<h3>Iterative User Stories</h3>
						<p>As team lead on a student project with <a href="https://honestybox.io/" target="">Honesty Box</a> (a network analytics start-up), I introduced the concept of iterative user stories into our team. Due to the experimental and spike focused nature of the project, this was an ideal situation to test this style of development. The case study outlines the background research into iterative user stories, and explores the effect this way of working had on our projects development, and on how we thought of and described acceptance criteria.</p>

						<h3>Application of Agile Methodologies within Human Centred Design</h3>
						<p>This research project looks at the handling of user-centred and non-functional requirements with the current applications of agile methodologies. The research and development outlined in this proposal looks at the current limitations of existing agile applications, and asks how we can develop an alternative workflow model to better suit user driven projects.</p>

						<h3>Automation for City Planning</h3>
						<p>This paper deals with the NSW city planning system, examining how the limitations in technology affect the field, and in turn how the policies and procedures within the field limit the implementation of automation. The idea for this project came about from a hackathon I ran through the UTS Programmers’ Society, where the focus was on the development of Sydney as a city through technology.</p>
						<p>As part of this research, a workshop was co-conducted by myself and a UNSW city planning student Pulock Islam as part of his thesis work. The report outlines the structure of the workshop, its benefits, and the resulting arguments and recommendations.</p>
